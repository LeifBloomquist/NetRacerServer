Here's the source for my NetRacer game server, written in Java SE 5.   It's very simple, just a few classes.  Should be very easy to follow.

Thanks to Ian Colquhoun for his help by running the server on his machine for a couple of years. 

Check out my NetRacerClient repository for all the good stuff!

Server Issues:

-The code could probably be optimized in a few places, i.e. use a hashtable for matching IPs with players, reuse the same DatagramPacket object instead of creating a new one on each loop, and so on.

-I think TRACK_LENGTH_PIXELS is wrong, because I've observed the cars 'jumping' several pixels ahead when at the finish line. 

-The logic for removing timed-out players is extremely clunky, the break is a hack to avoid exceptions when removing elements from the vector.  Further dropouts will be handled on the next loop, which works but not ideal.    

-Purists would (correctly) point out that there's too much networking code in the RaceCar class.


All that said, the code was very stable and the program ran without issue on Ian's machine for a number of years.
